# 0x0D. NoSQL
This project was about learning what a NoSQL database *is* and about a particular NoSQL database, MongoDB.
From their website:
> MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.

## MongoDB offers the following features:
- **Query support**: You can use many standard query types, such as matching (==), comparison (<, >), and regular expressions.
- **Data accommodation**: You can store virtually any kind of data, be it structured, partially structured, or even polymorphic.
- **Scalability**: It handles more queries just by adding more machines to the server cluster.
- **Flexibility and agility**: You can develop applications with it quickly.
- Document orientation and schemalessness: You can store all the information regarding a data model in a single document.
- **Adjustable schema**: You can change the schema of the database on the fly, which reduces the time needed to provide new features or fix existing problems.
- **Relational database functionalities**: You can perform actions common to relational databases, like indexing.

## MongoDB also offers some convenient features you might not found in other database systems
- **Scalability**: Whether you need a stand-alone server or complete clusters of independent servers, you can scale MongoDB to whatever size you need it to be.
- **Load-balancing support**: MongoDB will automatically move data across various shards.
- **Automatic failover support**: If your primary server goes down, then a new primary will be up and running automatically.
- **Management tools**: You can track your machines using the cloud-based MongoDB Management Service (MMS).
- **Memory efficiency**: Thanks to the memory-mapped files, MongoDB is often more efficient than relational databases.
